Welcome to ShapelyChipDesigns's documentation!
==============================================

ShapelyChipDesigns can be used to gather and manipulate geometric objects.

It is based on the Shapely-Package and mainly uses a class called BRANDNEWOBJECT:

    <div style="margin-top:10px;">
    <iframe width="800" height="350"scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="../../pyplots/img/E1_E3.html"></iframe>
    </div>

    <iframe width="700" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="../../pyplots/img/scatter_plot.html"></iframe>
    </div>

One BRANDNEWOBJECT can contain many Polygons on different layers. 
Global geometric operations such as rotations, translations and scaling can be used to manipulate all Polygons in the BRANDNEWOBJECT container at once.

Further anker points can be added, which will be affected by all this operations as well. 
Therefore if you want to attach one BRANDNEWOBJECT to another, you can just design them seperately and later attach them at the desired ANKER points:

This might be the 'important_dot' in the sketch above.

Here the circle is scaled, rotated and translated - the polygons are kept together and the important anker point is moving with the object:
